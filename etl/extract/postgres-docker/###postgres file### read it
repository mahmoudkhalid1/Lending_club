 I changed the structure so you don’t have to load the file every time you run Docker. The data’s already inside — you just need to run a couple of commands to access the tables.
 first : download the tar file and docker-compose file here the link  : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uuzkChHXtIOEmPt6DAs4mLK_vCYulQzd?usp=sharing
 in the folder you download the tar file open cmd type this commands:
 docker load -i my_postgres_with_data.tar
 docker-compose up -d
 docker exec -it my_postgres psql -U myuser -d mydb
then you have access to the tables
